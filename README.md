# Coursera_Project__Linear_Regression_with_Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing Linear Regression using Python and Numpy using a practical approach. The goal for the first part of the project is to leverage two independent variables (area and distance from the city center) to predict the price of a house. The second part is two leverage one independent variable (humidity) to predict the number of insect chirps.

## Data Understanding
For the first part of the project, a synthethic data is generated using the generate_examples function. The data consists of 1000 samples with two independent variables: area (in square feet) and distance from the city center (in miles). The dependent variable is the house price, which is calculated using a linear equation with some added noise.

For the second, additional project, the dataset is small, containing data points on humidity levels and number of insect chirps.

## Modeling and Evaluation
The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on two independent variables: area and distance from the city center. The concepts of linear regression and gradient descent are applied to find the best-fitting line for the data points by minimizing the loss function using mean squared error (MSE).

## Conclusion
A linear regression model was implemented for both projects, with steps taken to minimize the loss function through mean squared error. Finally, the predictions were made using the trained model, and the results were visualized to understand the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
